\title{Example of parameters used to govern postmitotic astrocyte differentiation produced by a multipotent progenitor}
\format{A list of 3 elements:
\describe{
  \item{probability}{Matrix with columns: probabilities of generating a BG (1st column), a GLA (2nd column), or a WMA (3rd column)
  
                                  rows :  for each generation in the simulated lineage (number of rows can vary)}
  \item{type}{The corresponding names of different possible outcome, in the same order as the columns of the probability matrix (BG, GLA, WMA) 
              (number of types correponds to the number of columns of the above probability matrix)}
  \item{generationInterval}{Vector of length corresponding to the number of generations, length equal to the number of rows of the matrix probability}
